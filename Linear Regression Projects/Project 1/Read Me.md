# Simple Pendulum Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to use linear regression to estimate the gravitational constant \( g \) from simple pendulum data. The data is loaded from an Excel file, visualized, and analyzed using a linear regression model.

## Description

The script performs the following steps:
1. Loads data from an Excel file.
2. Prepares and visualizes the data.
3. Splits the data into training and testing sets.
4. Creates and trains a linear regression model.
5. Evaluates the model's performance.
6. Estimates the gravitational constant \( g \) based on the model.
7. Visualizes the results.

## Requirements

To run this script, you need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
